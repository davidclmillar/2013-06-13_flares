Code for analysis and making figures for a paper about B-class flares on 2013-06-13

- ```sstanalysis.py```, ```Waveletfunctions.py``` and ```kappafitting.py``` contain lots of functions/classes used in the scripts

- use ```get_velocities.py``` to calculate Doppler shifts in CRISP data

- ```fit_spectra.py``` runs spectrum fitting on intensity or velocity data

- ```parallel_compare.py``` compares the results of the fits to get preferred models
